- ###  Souvic Chakraborty 

	- Supervisor: Animesh Mukherjee, Pawan Goyal 

	- Projects:

		-  Aspect based Sentiment Analysis of Scientific Reviews 


		-  We used publicly available dataset and with the help of annotations of aspect sentiments, we established the importance of each aspect like Clarity, the novelty of ideas on paper acceptance. We also studied the impact of disagreement between reviewers on Chair's decision, how aspect based disagreements have strong correlations with overall disagreements, and how each aspect sentiment influenced the degree of disagreement.
